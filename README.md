# My Java Game
Not to be distributed, some graphic designs are not my own, nor do I take ownership of any of the graphics or soundFX used in this game.
## Overview
(Tale of Yggdrasil.exe available for download to try the game on Windows)  
The main objectives of this project was to properly learn and under stand Object Oriented Programming practices and understand rendings and graphics on Java and also provided a environment for additional experimentation.  
A game I built in Java using Java's Swing and Grapics2D libraries.
Inspiration is drawn for games such as:
* Binding of Issac
* Enter the Gungeon
* Nuclear Throne
* Rogue
* Risk of Rain

## Media (Taken from or inspired by)
